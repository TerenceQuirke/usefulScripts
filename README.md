# usefulScripts
a collection of scripts to do various tasks

**PullLatestChangesForMainOrMaster.ps1**
I have this saved in the folder that has all my repos and then I can run it to fetch the latest changes for every repo( the branch chosen will be the main or master branch) and then I can just switch branches for specific things. you may need to update your script execution policy to be able to run the script. The first time you run it you will need to enable the oauth, but then after that you can run it as much as you want.
